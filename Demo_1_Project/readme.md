This is the folder for Team LJCubed's robotic performance of the following critical tasks:

• Detect an Aruco marker, and report the angle in degrees between the camera axis (i.e. an arrow pointing out of
  the camera perpendicular to the camera face) and the maker. The angle is signed, with a positive angle when the
  marker is to the left of the camera axis.
  
• Move forward in a straight line and stop after a specified distance in feet (between 1 and 10 feet).

• Rotate the robot by a specified angle in degrees, and move forward a specified distance in feet.
