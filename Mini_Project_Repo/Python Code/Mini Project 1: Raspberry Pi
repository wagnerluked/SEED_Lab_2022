# --------------------- Mini Project 1: Raspberry Pi Code ----------------------------
# This code will start out by running the Raspberry Pi camera which will be used to
# read an aruco marker. This marker will be moved to each corner of the cameras
# available sight and then send the Pi a quadrant number based off of which corner
# the marker is in. Once the Pi receives the quadrant number, it will que up the I2C
# protocol and send the Arduino that quadrant number. The Arduino will then move the
# motor to the appropriate quadrant and send back it's exact location to the Pi
# via I2C. The Pi will display both the current quadrant and the one that is being
# read from the Pi camera.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Hardware requirements:
# Raspberry Pi, Arduino and 3 wires to connect them together for the I2C link.
# LCD display, shield motor controller, motor, battery monitor, switch, and battery.
# Raspberry Pi camera and aruco marker.
# Various cables and wires for connecting everything.
